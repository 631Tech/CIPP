# What is GDAP

GDAP allows you to access your clients tenants according to the role you've set. This mean you are able to give one employee "helpdesk" access, and another employee "security" access.

GDAP requires a mapping between roles and security groups in your partner tenant. CIPP creates these groups and mappings for you. Do not select all roles. This is not supported by Microsoft and CIPP. Selecting all roles(or most roles) will guarantee unexpected results. Carefully consider which roles are required for your deployment.

GDAP relationships have a maximum age, but may auto-renew if setup correctly.
