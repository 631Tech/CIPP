# Executing the SAM Setup Wizard

The SAM Wizard only needs to be run **once** to connect to your tenant, including all partner tenants.

Your browser **MUST** allow cookies and have any ad-blocker disabled for the duration of the wizard. Do not use in-private mode.
{% endhint %}

To setup the connection to your tenants you'll need to run the Sam Wizard. The Sam Wizard can be found under CIPP -> SAM Setup Wizard.&#x20;

The Wizard will present you with multiple options. If this is your first setup it is recommended to choose "I'd like CIPP to create a SAM Application for me".
