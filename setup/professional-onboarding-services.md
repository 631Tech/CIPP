* **Learn how to configure regional settings** and custom domain names.
* **Identify and resolve common performance issues** related to region selection.
* **Use the CIPP management portal** for user role assignments and permissions.

This scope ensures you learn the essential steps and can replicate them for additional customers on your own. If you have specific needs, have already completed some steps, or need to focus on specific areas, discuss this with your CIPP expert prior to the scheduling of your first session. The focus will be on the listed objectives, and any unique requirements must be communicated upfront to be addressed within the allotted time.
