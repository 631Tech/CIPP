# Sponsor Quick Start

Welcome to your hosted instance of CIPP! If you've started the sponsorship process and are ready to enhance your management of Microsoft 365 tenants with efficiency, this guide is designed to get you started.

## **Initial Setup**

1. **Subscription Activation**:
   * Start by signing up for the $99 subscription using your GitHub account on the  [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/KelvinTegelaar/sponsorships?tier\_id=101398) page.
2. **Welcome Email**:
   * Upon subscription, you will receive an email with detailed instructions to kickstart your deployment. This email will guide you to our [management app](https://management.cipp.app), where you can initiate your deployment, add domain names, and begin inviting users to CIPP.

## **Deployment Steps**

3. **Service Account Creation**:
   * Follow the instructions carefully on the [Creating the CIPP Service Account](installation/creating-the-cipp-service-account-gdap-ready.md) page to ensure there are no permission issues when connecting your tenants within CIPP.
4. **Access Configuration**:
   * Log into your newly created CIPP app and follow the instructions on the [Executing the SAM Setup Wizard](installation/executing-the-sam-setup-wizard.md) which will assist in setting up access to your tenants in CIPP.

## **Managing Client Relationships**

5. **Existing GDAP Relationships**:
   * If your GDAP relationships with clients are already configured and you do not need to create new invites, proceed to [Adding Tenants & **Consenting in the CIPP-SAM Application**](installation/adding-tenants-and-consenting-the-cipp-sam-application.md) to start managing your clients immediately.
6. **New GDAP Relationships**:
   * If you need to establish new GDAP relationships, use the [GDAP Invite Wizard](gdap/gdap-invite-wizard.md) to generate invites. Once you have completed the invite process, follow up by consenting within the CIPP app.
