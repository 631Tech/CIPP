# Standards

## Overview

The Standards page provides the ability for you to apply or reapply specific standards to your entire client base. Standards are collections of configuration items applied to your M365 tenants. The standards in CIPP make sure your tenant is in a specific baseline by reapplying the setting every 3 hours. This prevents admins from making an accidental change that could impact security. Some of the standards are explained below.

**Important Points on Standards Configuration:**

* **Companion Policies:** Some standards require companion policies in Microsoft Intune to be effective. Ensure all necessary policies are set up to achieve the desired results.
* **Deselecting Standards:** Deselecting a standard prevents it from being applied but does not disable the current setting. e.g.: If you deselect `Enable FIDO2 capabilities`, the standard will stop enforcing it, but if it was already enabled, it remains on.
* **Precedence of Standards:** Tenant-level standards override `AllTenants` standards. e.g.: If `Enable or disable 'external' warning in Outlook` is set to `false` for a specific tenant, it will stay disabled for that tenant even if the `AllTenants` standard is `true`.
* **Application Cadence:** Standards reapply to your tenants every **three hours** by default. If a setting covered by a standard changes the next time the standards apply the value specified in the standard takes precedence.

This proves an issue for a lot of MSPs because those reports are often helpful for engineers. This standard applies a setting that shows usernames in those API calls / reports.                                              |
| Restrict guest user access to directory objects                   | Set-AzureADMSAuthorizationPolicy -GuestUserRoleId '2af84b1e-32c8-42b7-82bc-daa82404023b' | Sets it so guests can view only their own user profile.

This potentially prevents AITM attacks via EvilNginx. This will also automatically generate alerts if a clone of your login page has been found when set to Remediate.                                                                                                   |

| Enable OTP via Authenticator                                      | Update-MgBetaPolicyAuthenticationMethodPolicyAuthenticationMethodConfiguration           | Allows you to use Microsoft Authenticator OTP token generator. Useful for using the NPS extention as MFA on VPN clients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Set Authenticator Lite state                                      | Update-MgBetaPolicyAuthenticationMethodPolicyAuthenticationMethodConfiguration           | Sets the Authenticator Lite state to enabled. This allows users to use the Authenticator Lite built into the Outlook app instead of the full Authenticator app.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Enable FIDO2 capabilities                                         | Update-MgBetaPolicyAuthenticationMethodPolicyAuthenticationMethodConfiguration           | Enables FIDO2 capabilities for the tenant. This allows users to use FIDO2 keys like a Yubikey for authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Enable Hardware OAuth tokens                                      | Update-MgBetaPolicyAuthenticationMethodPolicyAuthenticationMethodConfiguration           | Enables Hardware OAuth tokens for the tenant. This allows users to use hardware tokens like a Yubikey for authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Enable OTP Software OAuth tokens                                  | Update-MgBetaPolicyAuthenticationMethodPolicyAuthenticationMethodConfiguration           | Enables OTP Software OAuth tokens for the tenant. This allows users to use OTP codes generated via software, like a password manager to be used as an authentication method                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Enable Temporary Access Passwords                                 | Update-MgBetaPolicyAuthenticationMethodPolicyAuthenticationMethodConfiguration           | Enables Temporary Password generation for the tenant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Disable M365 Tenant creation by users                             | Update-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy                                                       | Users by default are allowed to create M365 tenants. This disables that so only admins can create new M365 tenants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This gives the users the ability to report emails as spam or phish.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Microsoft's recommendation is to disable the user account for shared mailboxes. It would be a good idea to review the sign-in reports to establish potential impact. |

This will likely not have any user impact, but will block systems/applications depending on basic auth or the SharePointOnlineCredentials class.                                                        |

Only admins are able to approve add-ins for the users. This is done to reduce the threat surface for data exfiltration.                                                                                                                         |
